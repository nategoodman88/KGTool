        K&G Tool begins your Automation Solution with In-House Design consisting
        of a Senior and Associate Designer on staff. During the Design Process,
        our staff Electrical Engineer works with the Designers ensuring the
        integration of Automaton/Electrical/Pneumatic/Safety per cus- tomer
        requirements. With 30 plus years of Design experience & 25 years of
        Electrical back- ground, innovate and efficient solutions are developed
        with the latest automation technology providing your company with
        up-to-date, reliable, cost efficient and dependable equipment. Once the
        Design is approved by the customer, drawings are released to the Factory
        for Fabri- cation. With in-house Wire EDM, CNC Lathe & Mills, and
        Welding capability, fabrication time is minimized. Typically 100% of the
        fabrication is completed in-house reducing delivery times and allowing
        for direct Project Management. With several highly experienced
        Machinists, Machine Assemblers, and our Electrician, your project will
        receive end-to-end direct support from the Design and Electrical
        Engineers from Design to Delivery. Once the Machine is assembled and
        rigorously tested, we deliver to your agreed to delivery while exceeding
        your quality expectations.
