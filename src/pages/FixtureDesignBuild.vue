        Welding, Riveting, Ro- botic End of Arm and others. Design again
        consisting of a Senior and Associate Designer on staff. During the
        Design, our staff Electrical Engineer works from the beginning with the
        De- signers ensuring the Fixture Electrical/Pneumatic/Safety integration
        per customer specifica- tions. Once the Design is approved by the
        customer, drawings are released to the Factory for Fabri- cation. With
        in-house Wire EDM, CNC Lathe & Mills, and Welding capability fabrication
        time is minimized.. Typically, 100% of the fabrication is completed
        in-house reducing delivery times and allowing for direct Project
        Management. With several highly experienced Machinists, Machine
        Assemblers, and our Electrician, your project will receive end-to-end
        direct support from the Design and Electrical Engineers from Design to
        Delivery. Once the Fixture is assembled and rigorously tested, we
        deliver to your agreed to delivery while exceeding your quality
        expectations
